Each time 'Roll Button' is clicked:

  1. Must check if player remaining rollCount (initial rollLimit (5) - keptDiceCount) is equal to 0
    a) If remaining rollCount = 0, run player.finalScore (sum all dice values from keptDice EXCEPT if value is 3)
    b) Move to next player

  2. Must check that player has kept/selected at least one die.
    a) If no new die selected, then do not move on to next rolls and notify player
    b) If die selected, add to keptDice
    c) Update players's remaining rolls = initial rollLimit (5) - keptDiceCount
